## General PostgreSQL Server Behavior Rules

### Superuser Access
- The PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`) is the only user that can connect to and manage all databases.
- The superuser can access any database using both the primary domain (`example.com`) and its subdomains (e.g., `demo.example.com`).

### Database Creation Defaults
- When a new database is created, an admin user named `admin` is also created for that database.
- The `admin` user is granted full administrative privileges for its respective database.
- The `admin` user does **not** have access to any other databases.

### Database-Specific User Restrictions
- Any user created by the `admin` user is restricted to the specific database it was created in.
- These users cannot access other databases, ensuring strict database isolation.

### Subdomain-Based Access Control
- Each database is accessible only through its respective subdomain.
  - Example: If a database named `demo` is created, only `demo.example.com` can be used to connect.
  - Users of `demo` (including its `admin`) **cannot** access the database via `example.com`, only `demo.example.com`.
- The PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`) is the **only** user who can access any database through both `example.com` and subdomains like `demo.example.com`.

### Default PostgreSQL Behavior
- This setup reflects the default PostgreSQL behavior when using per-database user management.
- Role inheritance and access control lists (ACLs) are managed per database.
- Host-based authentication (HBA) and connection settings should enforce this subdomain-based restriction.

### Expected AI Behavior
- The AI should respect the described access control model when suggesting role assignments.
- When generating SQL scripts or configuration settings, it should align with the above rules.
- AI recommendations for connection configurations should ensure that:
  - Database-specific users are restricted to subdomain access.
  - The superuser retains unrestricted access.
  - Host-based authentication (pg_hba.conf) settings enforce these rules.
