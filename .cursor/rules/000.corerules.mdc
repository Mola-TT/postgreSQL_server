Key Requirements

1. PostgreSQL Installation & Configuration

Install PostgreSQL version 15.

Ensure PostgreSQL is properly initialized and configured.

Configure authentication with SCRAM-SHA-256 instead of MD5.

Enable SSL for secure connections.

Optimize default PostgreSQL settings for performance.

Allow automatic subdomain-to-database mapping.

2. Security Enhancements

Use SCRAM-SHA-256 for PostgreSQL and PgBouncer authentication.

Store and retrieve passwords securely using pgcrypto.

Ensure firewall (UFW) is configured properly.

Restrict default PUBLIC privileges in PostgreSQL.

Implement auto-restart for PostgreSQL & PgBouncer in case of failure.

3. PgBouncer Connection Pooling

Install and configure PgBouncer.

Use SCRAM-SHA-256 for user authentication.

Enable connection pooling with proper pool mode configuration.

Ensure PgBouncer's userlist.txt is updated dynamically.

Implement a systemd timer instead of a cron job for regular updates.

4. Server Monitoring & Auto-Healing

Monitor CPU, Memory, and Disk usage.

Implement email alerts for high resource usage.

Provide real-time logging via journalctl.

Restart PostgreSQL and PgBouncer automatically if they crash.

5. Automatic Performance Tuning

Auto-scale PostgreSQL settings based on CPU, RAM, and Disk size.

Adjust settings like shared_buffers, work_mem, and effective_io_concurrency dynamically.

Implement a self-healing mechanism for PostgreSQL clusters.

6. Logging & Debugging

Centralized logging script (pg_logs.sh) for PostgreSQL and PgBouncer.

Provide filtering options (time-based, error-only, etc.).

Log failed PostgreSQL connections and authentication errors.

7. Email & Notification System

Configure SMTP for email alerts.

Send alerts for PostgreSQL failures, high CPU/memory/disk usage, auto-scaling performed.

Send a test email after setup to confirm SMTP works.

9. Database User Management

Script to create restricted database users with limited access.

Ensure each user is isolated to their own database.

Revoke all PUBLIC privileges by default.

10. Documentation & Backup

Create a connection info file (connection_info.txt) with PostgreSQL credentials.

Backup the .env file dynamically with timestamps.

Provide manual recovery instructions for failed installations.

Additional Notes

The AI assistant should not remove useful features from previous versions unless necessary.

Ensure all scripts are modular and easy to maintain.

Use systemd services instead of cron jobs where possible.

Expected Output

The AI should generate:

A modular Bash script implementing all features.

Documentation for each script and feature.

A troubleshooting guide for PostgreSQL and PgBouncer issues.

Recommendations for further optimizations based on the latest best practices.
