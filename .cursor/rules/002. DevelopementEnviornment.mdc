Guidelines:
1. **Development Environment**
   - The script is developed on a Windows machine.
   - The script is not executed on Windows but will run on an Ubuntu server.
   - Use WSL (if needed) for compatibility checks.

2. **GitHub Workflow**
   - Each commit should contain only **one function change**.
   - Every commit must have a clear and concise message describing the function change.
   - After making changes, the script should be **automatically pushed to GitHub**.

3. **Automatic Git Commit & Push Script**
   - Use a PowerShell to handle commits and push changes to GitHub.
