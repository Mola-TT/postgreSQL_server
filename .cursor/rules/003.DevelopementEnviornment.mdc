Guidelines:
1. **GitHub Workflow**
   - Each commit should contain only **one function change**.
   - Every commit must have a clear and concise message describing the function change.
   - After making changes, the script should be **automatically pushed to GitHub**.

2. **Automatic Git Commit & Push Script**
   - Use a PowerShell to handle commits and push changes to GitHub.

# Issue Handling Guidelines

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do
- **Do NOT create a separate hotfix script.**  
  - Avoid patching issues with temporary fixes.
  - Keep the initialization script as the single source of truth.

## ‚úÖ What to Do Instead
1. **Fix the initialization script directly.**  
   - Identify and correct the issue in the main script.
   - Ensure the fix integrates smoothly into the existing setup process.

2. **Push the updated script to GitHub.**  
   - Commit the changes with a clear message describing the fix.
   - Use the automated Git push script if available.

## üéØ Goal
- Maintain a **clean and maintainable** setup process.
- Ensure **consistent deployments** without scattered fixes.
- Keep the script **self-sufficient and reliable**.
